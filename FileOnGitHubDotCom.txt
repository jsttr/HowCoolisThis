I added this file on the server. My next actions? Try to make a "pull" request? Basically download this to my local repo. Let's do it.

I just had to sync from GitHub on Windows to download this file. Pull request doesn't bring it down.

Push and Pull is not upload and download.

Push is a commit/upload- so long as you have shared access/commit access.
Pull is not essentially the "pulling down" of stuff from repository. It's more like asking to be pulled up to a repository that you don't have access to.

Another way to "pull down" would simply be forking. But that's pull down in layman's terms - when you think push and pull do the exact opposite things.
Which is probably why it's not just a plain "Pull" but a "Pull Request".

And I think I should make a gist of this text file! Or should I?


ha! So a pull request is my P4 equivalent of merge and integrate - except on a forked branch (usually) - and I'm not really the owner
of the master branch (or source branch) so I have to ask them to "pull" my changes - review and accept to integrate them.
There's an auto merge as well as manual merge - much like good ol' p4.
